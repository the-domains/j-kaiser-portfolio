Sasol Young Explorer App Series

Working on this app series has been one of my favourite projects this year. The brief was to design an educational app series based on the 'My First Book of' series published by Struik Nature. The project became something so much more than any of us working on it anticipated - so much more than just the sum of its parts. The best part of this project, seeing kids interacting with it and seeing just how much fun they have!
