Right from the start, while still conseptualising and planning this project, I really wanted to focus on high quality graphics throughout the process. I wanted to design something that was timeless, that could endear itself to its audience, and that would assure parents, who bought it for thier little ones, they had purchased something of real value. The following 5 graphics are screenshots from the app.
